    "The idea behind the Ribo-seq protocol can be summarised in a few lines: ribosome-protected fragments or footprints (RNA protected by the ribosome), can be isolated through the use of nucleases that degrade unprotected RNA regions, and submitted to a deep sequencing protocol similar to those used for RNA. In brief, *(i)* ribosome-bound RNA is isolated from cell/tissue lysates; *(ii)* treated with a drug, depending on the purpose of the experiment, *e.g* elongating (cycloheximide, but can distort ribosome profiles as initiation can continue even though elongation is blocked, which can lead to high ribosome density at alternative initiation sites) or initiating ribosomes (harringtonine, lactimidomycin/puromycin), for eukaryotes, the choice of inhibitor has a concentration-dependent impact on the kinetics of initiation and elongation; *(iii)* nucleases are added to digest the unprotected RNA (RNase), the choice of nuclease and treatment strongly affect the ribosome profiles; *(iv)* after footprint recovery, rRNA depletion is performed and samples are sequenced, but protocols vary a lot (circularisation step or no, bias reduction methods, *etc*), and there are always new methods!

Ribo-seq has been used to answer a wide range of questions, including identification of translated small open reading frames (ORFs), non-coding sequences and alternative reading frames, quantification of translational control (in combination with RNA-seq, *i.e* translational efficiency, or regulatory mechanisms associated with the translation process itself, such as upstream ORFs acting in cis, or translation regulating transcript stability by triggering NMD via recognition of a premature stop codon), or for gaining mechanistic insights on the translation process itself.\n",

    "Conceptually, actively translated ORFs are predicted based on ribosome density. In general, however, ribosome occupancy itself, as indicated by the fragment reads mapped on the transcriptome, is not sufficient (due to noise from ligation bias in cloning ribosome footprints and amplification by PCR, regulatory RNAs that bind with the ribosome, ribosome engagement without translation, *etc.*). The technique allows to recover the precise location of the peptidyl-site (P-site) of the ribosome within each fragment or read, owing to its single-nucleotide resolution. Aligned by their P-site positions, the reads from actively translating ribosomes should therefore exhibit a 3-nt periodicity along the ORF. To select reads and predict translation, `rpbp` takes advantage of this 3-nt periodicity.\n"
